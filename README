------------------------------------------------------
This software is also referenced as 8085sim. 

Update:August 2019:
The source code was initially uploaded in 2010 at https://sourceforge.net/projects/j8085sim/
I would have liked this to be a project which uses Maven/Gradle. But unfortunately I didn't knew about them when I created this project initially - this is a NetBeans project. Currently I do not have time to add this. If anyone is willing to add Maven, please create a pull request. Thanks!

-------------------

FEATURES:
Supports all 8085 instructions and all interrupts.

Read the manual.pdf file for detailed instructions

What's missing? - This program donot support serial in/out feature. It was something which could be included easily. But I was sort of lazy :)
But its something which students dont use much - I haven't anyway!. So I suppose this would be okay. But if some one really need it, please try 
to contribute it. 

If you find any instruction not working as it is supposed to do, please contact me.
